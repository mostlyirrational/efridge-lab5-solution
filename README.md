#Crime Hunters

##Task

This week's lab involves loading data from the Atlanta police department into a database for easy searching.

- Create a Mongo DB Atlas account and collection
- Set up the database configuration in the app under `models/db.js`
- Load the data into the db by accessing "/load"

After loading the data, we will implement a crime controller that will search our database for crimes of a particular type.
